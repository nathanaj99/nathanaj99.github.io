Hello! My name is Nathan and I'm an incoming PhD student in Computer Science at MIT. I’m broadly interested in the societal impacts of AI — particularly questions around equity and technology governance. This often entails using tools at the intersection of machine learning, operations research, and behavioral economics.

Currently, I work as a research fellow at the [Regulation, Evaluation, and Governance Lab (RegLab)][reglab] at Stanford University advised by [Dan Ho][danho]. I was previously researching at the [USC Center for AI in Society][usc-cais] under [Phebe Vayanos][phebevayanos]. I received my Master's degree in Data Science and my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Southern California in 2021.
